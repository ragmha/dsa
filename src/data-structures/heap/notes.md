## Heap

> A specialized tree based data strcuture that satisfies the heap property

* Efficiency - Heaps allow for efficent reterival and modification of the highest or lowest element, which is crucial for priority queues
* Ordering - Ensures well defined order for quick access to the priority element without the need to sort the entire dataset
* Memory usage - implemented using arrays, have a compact memory footprint
* Flexibility - dynamic, meaning they can grow and shrink as needed


E.g
- Priority Queues
- Sorting Algorithmns
- Graph Algorithms
- File Compression
- Dynamic Programming
- Medical Applications
- Load balancing
